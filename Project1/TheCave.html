        <h3>How you got here...</h3>
        <p>
            The legends were old and the common folk didn't believe.
            The great wizards, in their towers of learning, scoffed that such a thing could exist.  Yet...
        </p>
        <p>
            In your family’s history, an ancient ancestor's journal speaks of the Cave of Gems.  Magical gems.
            The possessor of such would have the power of a high-level mage at their fingertips!
            Alas, your ancestor did not survive the trip, though his remains, and journal were found
            floating in the river that passes through your family's lands.  But that was hundreds of years ago..
        </p>
        <p>
            It is desperate times for your family.  The king's taxes are driving your family bankrupt
            while the mages extort a heavy price to NOT curse your lands.  You decided to venture forth and find the cave.
            Then you can get the gems, defy the mages and bless your lands so you can pay the king.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything was going well.  You followed the river, figuring you could find the cave at it's source.  But the
            river disappeared into the side of a cliff.  You climbed the cliff, and after searching the plain above,
            found a small stream that seemed to dive into the ground.  As you approached, the ground gave way beneath you,
            plunging you into darkness.....
